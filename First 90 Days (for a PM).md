# First 90 Days (for a PM)

## Summary
Currently re-reading First 90 Days by Michael Watkins in prep for a new role. Recorded here are my notes. This book provides a great framework for starting any job, I want to fill in the blanks to focus on the first 90 days as a PM joining an org as a mid-level IC. Will update/add sections for MoM once I get there...

The First 90 Days framework seeks to be general, applicable to multiple disciplines, and written almost a decade ago. I seek to tailor my own First 90 Days plan with regards to my needs as a PM. 

# The Plan

## De-program / Re-program from last role
The goal here is the reset from the last role, gather learnings from that experience, and re-contract on best practices so that I can put my best foot forward when starting my new role. I want to start my new role, with a fresh mind, while having strong opinions, weakly held so that I am able to bring forth good ideas, but remain adaptable for the situation at hand. 

### Checklist

## Month 1 - Learning Tour
The Goal here is to learn as much as possible, in the shortest period of time. I want to drink from the firehose and get up to speed as soon as possible. At the same time, I want to enumerate A-list priorities for the business. I can also begin to identify and build my network and resources within the company. 

### Answers I need
